Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

=========

AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets you
use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control. Oh yeah and it also helps with
server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side
navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. The best of all:
it makes development fun!
